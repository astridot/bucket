# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently, all versions of Bucket releases including `bkt` (PyPI release) are supported
for security updates. If these vulnerabilities are severe, the release will be deleted
immediately and further action will be taken about the situation.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability in a Bucket/`bkt` release, you have two options:

**For severe vulnerabilities**, please email Astridot (founder, sole maintainer) directly at `pixilreal@gmail.com`.
                                This will ensure that exploiters do not try to take advantage of it.
**For less severe vulnerabilities**, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/astridot/bucket/issues/new)
